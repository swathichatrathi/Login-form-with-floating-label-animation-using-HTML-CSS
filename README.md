A Login Form is a collection of credentials used to validate a user. Most often, these consist of a username and password. The login form is used by websites, computer applications, and mobile apps. A floating label is a text that appears inside the input field. When the user interacted with the input, the label “floats” above and making room for the user to input a value.

In this program (Login Form with Floating Label Animation), on the webpage, there is a Login Form with two input fields – Email and Password, a forgot password link, remember me checkbox, a button, and a signup link. When you focus on the input field, the label or text of the input float above.
